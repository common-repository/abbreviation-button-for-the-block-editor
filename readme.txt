Add an abbreviation format button to the formatting toolbar in the block editor.

== Description ==

The goal of this plugin is to provide expansions or definitions for abbreviations by using the `abbr` HTML element. It helps to make your website compliant to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/abbreviations.html">success criterion 3.1.4 of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>.

It is always appropriate to use the `abbr` element for any abbreviation, including acronyms and initialisms. This HTML element helps to make sure the abbreviation is understood by assistive technologies, by informing the user agent that the characters are an abbreviation, and by providing its meaning using the `title` attribute.

This plugin adds a new `abr` format button in the formatting toolbar of the block editor.
